# Mixup Contrastive Learning

Code for mixup contrastive learning framework for time series. The notebook "MixupContrastiveLearningExample.ipynb" illustrates how to perform the learning and test on some simple time series datasets.

# Results on all univariate and multivariate datasets

The folders UcrResults and UeaResults contains the results on all datasets in the UCR and UEA databases for all methods considered. They also containts the results across all 5 folds for the learning based methods.


# Some additional notes (from Ziyuan)
Exported conda environment requirement but may contain unnecessary packages (yes, I'm lazy and just used a generic 
environment for this model)
